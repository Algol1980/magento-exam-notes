# How and when is the include path set up and the auto loader registered?

- These are loaded once the Mage file has been included in the index.php before Mage::run();
- This uses an array of set_include_paths to search the 3 codepools and lib directories for files.
- Classes are loaded by separating the underscore as the directory separator in teh autload class and found in the 4 include directories.

More info on autoloading can be found [here](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/1.%20Basics/1.%20Architecture/6.%20Explain%20class%20naming%20conventions%20and%20their%20relationship%20with%20the%20autoloader.md)
