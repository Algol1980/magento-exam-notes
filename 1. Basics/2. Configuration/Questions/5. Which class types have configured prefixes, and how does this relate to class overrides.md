# Which class types have configured prefixes, and how does this relate to class overrides?

Not too sure about this question but I think this is what it means:

You can override classes in 2 ways:

- Config Rewrite
- Adding a class file relative in another codePool that is loaded beforehand.
e.g. create app/code/local/Mage/Core/Model/Product.php to override Mage_Catalog_Model_Product

This is not recommended but can be done due to the multiple paths used in set_include_path() in app/Mage.php.
